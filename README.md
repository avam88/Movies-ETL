# Creation of an Automated ETL Pipeline for Analysis of Movie Data
The scope of the project covers the complete automation of an ETL pipeline to scrape movie data from web sources Kaggle.com and IMDB.com and export the cleaned, transformed and merged data into a SQL database for further analysis. The project will explore the use of RegEx, Lambda Functions and Regular Functions to consolidate python code into a powerfully dense refactored script. 

### Resources : raw movie data scraped from kaggle.com and imdb.com
